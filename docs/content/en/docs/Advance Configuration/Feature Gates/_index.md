  Configuration guide for Redis Operator feature gates
---

Redis Operator supports feature gates to enable alpha/experimental features. These can be configured in the Helm chart values.

## Configuration

Feature gates can be configured in the Helm chart values:

```yaml
featureGates:
  # Enable generating Redis configuration using an init container instead of a regular container
  GenerateConfigInInitContainer: false
```

## Available Feature Gates

### GenerateConfigInInitContainer

When enabled, Redis configuration will be generated using an init container instead of a regular container. This is an alpha feature and may change in future releases.

**Default**: `false`

**Usage**:
```yaml
featureGates:
  GenerateConfigInInitContainer: true
```

## Feature Gate Lifecycle

Feature gates follow a standard lifecycle:

1. **Alpha**: Features are disabled by default and may be changed in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice.
2. **Beta**: Features are enabled by default and may be changed in incompatible ways in a later software release.
3. **GA**: Features are enabled by default and will not be changed in incompatible ways in a later software release.

Alpha features are experimental and may be changed or removed in future releases. Use them with caution in production environments.

## Adding New Feature Gates

When adding new feature gates to Redis Operator:

1. Define the feature gate in `internal/features/features.go`
2. Add the feature gate to `DefaultRedisOperatorFeatureGates`
3. Update the Helm chart values to include the new feature gate
4. Update this documentation with the new feature gate details
