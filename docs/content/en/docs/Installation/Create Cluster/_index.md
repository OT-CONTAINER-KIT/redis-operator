  Instructions for creating a Kubernetes cluster and installing Redis Operator on it
---

Redis Operator needs a Kubernetes or Openshift cluster for provisioning a Redis setup. This guide helps in setting up a Kubernetes cluster from a quickstart perspective. 

Tools involved in this kind of setup:

- [Eksctl](https://eksctl.io/)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

## Amazon EKS Cluster

To create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, we need to download and install the [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/) on the local system and then [eks-cluster.yaml](https://github.com/OT-CONTAINER-KIT/redis-operator/blob/master/example/eks-cluster.yaml) can be executed with it for cluster creation.

The content of [eks-cluster.yaml](https://github.com/OT-CONTAINER-KIT/redis-operator/blob/master/example/eks-cluster.yaml) looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig
metadata:
  name: operator-testing
  region: us-west-2
  version: "1.22"
managedNodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1
    instanceType: t3a.medium
    desiredCapacity: 3
    volumeSize: 30
    ssh:
      allow: true
    volumeType: gp3
kubernetesNetworkConfig:
  ipFamily: IPv4
# ipFamily: IPv6
addons:
  - name: vpc-cni
  - name: coredns
  - name: kube-proxy
iam:
  withOIDC: true
```

```shell
$ eksctl create cluster -f example/eks-cluster.yaml

## Minikube

Minikube is a tool for creation of Kubernetes on local system for Development purpose. It requires a [Docker](https://docker.com) compatible system or virtual machine environment.

```shell
$ minikube start --vm-driver virtualbox
