A Golang based redis operator that will make/oversee Redis standalone/cluster/replication/sentinel mode setup on top of the Kubernetes. It can create a redis cluster setup with best practices on Cloud as well as the Bare-metal environment. Also, it provides an in-built monitoring capability using redis-exporter.
