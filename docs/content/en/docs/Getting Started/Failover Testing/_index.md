  Instructions for testing the failover of Redis cluster
---

For cluster setup, testing can be performed to validate the failover functionality of Redis. In the failover testing, we can set some random keys inside the redis cluster and then delete one or two pods from the redis cluster. At that particular time, we can make some calls to redis for fetching the key to observing its failover mechanism of it.

Before failover testing, we have to write some dummy data inside the Redis cluster, we can write the dummy data using the `redis-cli`.

```shell
$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-leader-0 -n ot-operators \
    -- redis-cli -c set tony stark
...
OK
```

Verify the key has been inserted properly inside the redis by fetching its value. Again we will use `redis-cli` for fetching the key from redis.

```shell
$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-leader-0 -n ot-operators \
    -- redis-cli -c get tony
...
"stark"
```

To validate the failover functionality, we need to delete few of the pods from the redis cluster. `kubectl` cli could be use for deleting pods from the cluster.

```shell
$ kubectl delete pod redis-cluster-leader-0 -n ot-operators
...
pod "redis-cluster-leader-0" deleted
```

Since we have restarted `redis-cluster-leader-0` pod, we will again list out the redis nodes using `redis-cli` to see if follower node attached to it is promoted as leader or not. Also, the leader role should have been changed to follower role.

```shell
$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-leader-0 -n ot-operators \
    -- redis-cli cluster nodes
...

```

So if you notice the output of cluster nodes command, the node IP is updated, and itâ€™s connected as a leader.

```shell
$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-follower-1 -n ot-operators \
    -- redis-cli -c get tony
...
"stark"
```
